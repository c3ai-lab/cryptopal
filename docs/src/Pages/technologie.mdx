# How it works

<p>
  CryptoPal is a payment provider for cryptocurrency based on blockchain
  technology. Therefore it uses the xDai chain, a sidechain of the Ethereum
  blockchain. In this section we will describe in detail what CryptoPal does as
  a service and why it is the best choice for you as your payment provider.
</p>

## Blockchain Technology

<p>
  Blockchain technology enables decentralized, transparent and safe execution of
  transaction. The backbone of CryptoPal is the xDai chain, a sidechain of the
  Ethereum blockchain. It enables a fast and nearly fee free throughput of
  transactions by using xDai, a stable coin bound to USD, as the native coin. In
  this way we can guarantee the lowest fees on the market and make the service
  attractive for micro payments. By claiming balance on CryptoPal you claim some
  xDai which are stable and transferable at any time for nearly no fees.
</p>

## Wallet data

<p>
  For using blockchain technology, users have to setup third party extensions
  like Metamask to interact with the diffrent blockchain networks. To have
  access to it users have to store keys for managing their wallet. This is where
  CryptoPal shines. We take away the key management from the user and store
  encrypted keys safely. All the user has to care about are his credentials to
  log in to the service and transfer value by using blockchain technology.
  CryptoPal does all the technologic things for you in the background. This is
  handling keys, user data and sending transactions via the xDai network.
</p>

## Testnet implementation

<p>
  Currently the service is running on Sokol testnet for the xDai chain and using
  ERC20 tokens due to liquidity reasons. By going live this will change to xDai
  mainchain and using native xDai token for transfers.
